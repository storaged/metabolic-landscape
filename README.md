# metabolic-landscape-analysis

The repository contains scripts and functions used in the study presented in the article: 

*Low entropy sub-networks prevent the integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data.*

Outline of the content:
- *binary measures* contains all functions that were used to calculate the similarity/difference between binary vectors;
- *data-processing* is composed of functions that help reading the data (transcriptomic data, metabolic network);
- *example-datasets* showcase the data used in the study;
- *figures-generation* example scripts for the generations of the figures;
- *recon-structure* analysis of the topology and structure of the metabolic network;
- *simplex-pipeline* includes a bash script that performs computation of landscapes along with required python scripts and listed prerequisites.
